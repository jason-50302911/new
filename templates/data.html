                        <br><b>SAFTY</b>:Currently, there are no specified occupational exposure limits for methane gas. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) in the<br> United States recommends a maximum of 1000 ppm (0.1%) during an eight-hour work period.
                        <br><b>DANGER</b>:Methane is a highly flammable and
                        explosive gas, quickly ignited when
                        exposed to heat, sparks or flames. When
                        CH4 accumulates, 5 â€“ 15% by volume,
                        within a mixture of air, it forms a highly
                        explosive gas. Above 15% (150,000
                        ppm), insufficient oxygen is present in
                        the air.
                        <br><b>GREENHOUSE GAS</b>:Methane has been rapidly increased.The global warming potential (GWP) for methane is about 84 in terms of its impact over a 20-year timeframe. That means it traps 84 times more heat per mass unit than carbon dioxide (CO2) and 105 times the effect when accounting for aerosol interactions.
